# Orbit CLI

A very basic implementation of a CLI for the Orbit AI chatbot by Mozilla.

This is just a simple POC and not is not planning to be a full implementation.

## Usage

```bash
bun start
```

## Notes

Reverse engineering efforts were mainly conducted by investigating the network requests made by the Orbit AI chatbot extension for Firefox.

Inspecting of the extension's network requests can be done by opening the debugging menu in Firefox here: [about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox](about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox)
